Repository set up with labels

Default labels set for the organisation in Settings > (Code, planning and automation) General are only applied to new repositories.

Following the [blog](https://napjose.ph/posts/copy-issue-labels-from-another-github-repository) to copy labels across repositories using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
this is a new repository to help try this out.
